|Are Am stars and hot-Jupiter planets related?|C. Saffe et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14257v1|

### Abstract
Am stars are often components of short-period binary systems, where tidal interactions would result in low rotational velocities and help to develop the chemical peculiarities observed. However, the origin of single Am stars and Am stars that belong to wide binary systems is unclear. There is very recent evidence of an Am star hosting a hot-brown dwarf likely synchronized and other possible Am stars hosting hot-Jupiter planets. We wonder if these hot-low mass companions could play a role in the development of an Am star, that is to say, if they could help to mitigate the "single Am" problem. We studied a sample of 19 early-type stars, 7 of them hosting hot-brown dwarfs and 12 of them hosting hot-Jupiter planets. We detected 4 Am stars in our sample (KELT-19A, KELT-17, HATS-70 and TOI-503) and 2 possible Am stars (TOI-681 and HAT-P-69). In particular, we detected the new Am star HATS-70 which hosts a hot-brown dwarf, and rule out this class for the hot-Jupiter host WASP-189, both showing different composition than previously reported. We estimated the incidence of Am stars within stars hosting hot-brown dwarfs (50-75%) and within stars hosting hot-Jupiters (20-42%). The incidence of Am stars hosting hot-brown dwarfs resulted higher than the frequency of Am stars in general. This would imply that the presence of hot-brown dwarfs could play a role in the development of Am stars and possibly help to mitigate the "single Am" problem, different to the case of hot-Jupiter planets. Notably, these results would also indicate that the search for hot-brown dwarfs may be benefited by targeting single Am stars or Am stars in wide binary systems. We encourage the analysis off additional early-type stars hosting hot-companions in order to improve the significance of the initial trends found here. [abridged]

|Analytical determination of orbital elements using Fourier analysis. II. Gaia astrometry and its combination with radial velocities|J. -B. Delisle et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13992v1|

### Abstract
The ESA global astrometry space mission Gaia has been monitoring the position of a billion stars since 2014. The analysis of such a massive dataset is challenging in terms of the data processing involved. In particular, the blind detection and characterization of single or multiple companions to stars (planets, brown dwarfs, or stars) using Gaia astrometry requires highly efficient algorithms. In this article, we present a set of analytical methods to detect and characterize companions in scanning space astrometric time series as well as via a combination of astrometric and radial velocity time series. We propose a general linear periodogram framework and we derive analytical formulas for the false alarm probability (FAP) of periodogram peaks. Once a significant peak has been identified, we provide analytical estimates of all the orbital elements of the companion based on the Fourier decomposition of the signal. The periodogram, FAP, and orbital elements estimates can be computed for the astrometric and radial velocity time series separately or in tandem. These methods are complementary with more accurate and more computationally intensive numerical algorithms (e.g., least-squares minimization, Markov chain Monte Carlo, genetic algorithms). In particular, our analytical approximations can be used as an initial condition to accelerate the convergence of numerical algorithms. Our formalism has been partially implemented in the Gaia exoplanet pipeline for the third Gaia data release. Since the Gaia astrometric time series are not yet publicly available, we illustrate our methods on the basis of Hipparcos data, together with on-ground CORALIE radial velocities, for three targets known to host a companion: HD 223636 (HIP 117622), HD 17289 (HIP 12726), and HD 3277 (HIP 2790).

|The role of magnetic fields in the formation of protostars, disks, and outflows|Yusuke Tsukamoto et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13765v1|

### Abstract
We present our current understanding of the formation and early evolution of protostars, protoplanetary disks, and the driving of outflows as dictated by the interplay of magnetic fields and partially ionized gas in molecular cloud cores. In recent years, the field has witnessed enormous development through sub-millimeter observations which in turn have constrained models of protostar formation. As a result of these observations % that the observations provided, the state-of-the-art theoretical understanding of the formation and evolution of young stellar objects is described. In particular, we emphasize the importance of the coupling, decoupling, and re-coupling between weakly ionized gas and the magnetic field on appropriate scales. This highlights the complex and intimate relationship between gravitational collapse and magnetic fields in young protostars.

|SPECULOOS Northern Observatory: searching for red worlds in the northern skies|Artem Y. Burdanov et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09112v2|

### Abstract
SPECULOOS is a ground-based transit survey consisting of six identical 1-m robotic telescopes. The immediate goal of the project is to detect temperate terrestrial planets transiting nearby ultracool dwarfs (late M-dwarf stars and brown dwarfs), which could be amenable for atmospheric research with the next generation of telescopes. Here, we report the developments of the northern counterpart of the project - SPECULOOS Northern Observatory, and present its performance during the first three years of operations from mid-2019 to mid-2022. Currently, the observatory consists of one telescope, which is named Artemis. The Artemis telescope demonstrates remarkable photometric precision, allowing it to be ready to detect new transiting terrestrial exoplanets around ultracool dwarfs. Over the period of the first three years after the installation, we observed 96 objects from the SPECULOOS target list for 6000 hours with a typical photometric precision of $0.5\%$, and reaching a precision of $0.2\%$ for relatively bright non-variable targets with a typical exposure time of 25 sec. Our weather downtime (clouds, high wind speed, high humidity, precipitation and/or high concentration of dust particles in the air) over the period of three years was 30% of overall night time. Our actual downtime is 40% because of additional time loss associated with technical problems.

|A millimeter-multiwavelength continuum study of VLA 1623 West|Arnaud Michel et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06781v2|

### Abstract
VLA 1623 West is an ambiguous source that has been described as a shocked cloudlet as well as a protostellar disk. We use deep ALMA 1.3 and 0.87 millimeter observations to constrain its shape and structure to determine its origins better. We use a series of geometric models to fit the uv visibilities at both wavelengths with GALARIO. Although the Real visibilities show structures similar to what has been identified as gaps and rings in protoplanetary disks, we find that a modified Flat-Topped Gaussian at high inclination provides the best fit to the observations. This fit agrees well with expectations for an optically thick, highly inclined disk. Nevertheless, we find that the geometric models consistently yield positive residuals at the four corners of the disk at both wavelengths. We interpret these residuals as evidence that the disk is flared in the millimeter dust. We use a simple toy model for an edge-on flared disk and find that the residuals best match a disk with flaring that is mainly restricted to the outer disk at $R \gtrsim 30$ au. Thus, VLA 1623W may represent a young protostellar disk where the large dust grains have not yet had enough time to settle into the mid-plane. This result may have implications for how disk evolution and vertical dust settling impact the initial conditions leading to planet formation.

|The KOBE experiment: K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets. Project goals, target selection and stellar characterization|J. Lillo-Box et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05205v2|

### Abstract
The detection of habitable worlds is one of humanity's greatest endeavors. So far, astrobiological studies show that one of the most critical components for life development is liquid water. Its chemical properties and its capacity to dissolve and hence transport other substances makes this constituent a key piece in the development of life. As a consequence, looking for life as we know it is directly related to the search for liquid water. For a remote detection of life in distant planetary systems, this means looking for planets in the so-called habitable zone. In this sense, K-dwarf stars are the perfect hosts. Contrary to G-dwarfs, the habitable zone is closer, thus making planet detection easier using transit or radial velocity techniques. Contrary to M-dwarfs, the stellar activity is much smaller, hence having a smaller impact in both the detectability and in the true habitability of the planet. Also, K-dwarfs are the quietest in terms of oscillations, and granulation noise. Despite this, there is a dearth of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs due to a lack of observing programs devoted to this parameter space. In response to a call for Legacy Programs of the Calar Alto observatory, we have started the first dedicated and systematic search for habitable planets around K-dwarfs, the K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE). This survey is monitoring the radial velocity of 50 carefully pre-selected K-dwarfs with the CARMENES instrument along 5 semesters with an average of 90 data points per target. Based on planet occurrence rates convolved with our detectability limits, we expect to find $1.68\pm 0.25$ planets per star in the KOBE sample and in half of the sample we expect to find one of those planets within the habitable zone. In this paper, we describe the project motivation, goals and target selection and preliminary stellar characterization.

|Impacts of thrusting, extensional faulting, and glaciation on cratering records of Pluto's largest moon Charon: Implications for the evolution of Kuiper belt objects|Hanzhang Chen et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12859v2|

### Abstract
Systematic geomorphological mapping and detailed landform analysis using the highest resolution images obtained by the New Horizons spacecraft reveal the presence of a range of differentiable terrains on Charon, the largest moon of Pluto, that were not examined in detail by the early studies. The most important findings of our work include (1) truncation and omission of large craters (diameters > 30-40 km) and their crater rim ridges along the eastern edges of several north-trending, eastward-convex, arcuate ranges in Oz Terra, (2) lobate ridges, lobate knob trains, and lobate aprons resembling glacial moraine landforms on Earth, (3) dendritic channel systems containing hanging valleys, and (4) locally striated surfaces defined by parallel ridges, knob trains, and grooves that are > 40-50 km in length. The above observations and the topographic dichotomy of Charon' s encountered hemisphere can be explained by a landscape-evolution model that involves (i) a giant impact that created the Vulcan Planitia basin and the extensional fault zone along its northern rim, (ii) a transient atmosphere capable of driving N2-ice glacial erosion of the water-ice bedrock and transporting water-ice debris to sedimentary basins, (iii) regional glacial erosion and transport of earlier emplaced impact ejecta deposits from the highlands of Oz Terra into the lowland basin of Vulcan Planitia, (iv) syn-glaciation north-trending thrusting interpreted to have been induced by Charon' s despinning, and (v) the development of a water-ice debris cover layer over subsurface N2 ice below Vulcan Planitia during global deglaciation. The infilling of the Vulcan Planitia could have been accompanied by cryovolcanism. The extensive modification of impact craters means that the crater size-frequency distributions from Charon should serve only as a lower bound when used to test the formation mechanism of Kuiper belt objects.
