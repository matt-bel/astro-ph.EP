|Are Am stars and hot-Jupiter planets related?||C. Saffe et al.||http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14257v1|
Am stars are often components of short-period binary systems, where tidal interactions would result in low rotational velocities and help to develop the chemical peculiarities observed. However, the origin of single Am stars and Am stars that belong to wide binary systems is unclear. There is very recent evidence of an Am star hosting a hot-brown dwarf likely synchronized and other possible Am stars hosting hot-Jupiter planets. We wonder if these hot-low mass companions could play a role in the development of an Am star, that is to say, if they could help to mitigate the "single Am" problem. We studied a sample of 19 early-type stars, 7 of them hosting hot-brown dwarfs and 12 of them hosting hot-Jupiter planets. We detected 4 Am stars in our sample (KELT-19A, KELT-17, HATS-70 and TOI-503) and 2 possible Am stars (TOI-681 and HAT-P-69). In particular, we detected the new Am star HATS-70 which hosts a hot-brown dwarf, and rule out this class for the hot-Jupiter host WASP-189, both showing different composition than previously reported. We estimated the incidence of Am stars within stars hosting hot-brown dwarfs (50-75%) and within stars hosting hot-Jupiters (20-42%). The incidence of Am stars hosting hot-brown dwarfs resulted higher than the frequency of Am stars in general. This would imply that the presence of hot-brown dwarfs could play a role in the development of Am stars and possibly help to mitigate the "single Am" problem, different to the case of hot-Jupiter planets. Notably, these results would also indicate that the search for hot-brown dwarfs may be benefited by targeting single Am stars or Am stars in wide binary systems. We encourage the analysis off additional early-type stars hosting hot-companions in order to improve the significance of the initial trends found here. [abridged]

|Analytical determination of orbital elements using Fourier analysis. II. Gaia astrometry and its combination with radial velocities||J. -B. Delisle et al.||http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13992v1|
The ESA global astrometry space mission Gaia has been monitoring the position of a billion stars since 2014. The analysis of such a massive dataset is challenging in terms of the data processing involved. In particular, the blind detection and characterization of single or multiple companions to stars (planets, brown dwarfs, or stars) using Gaia astrometry requires highly efficient algorithms. In this article, we present a set of analytical methods to detect and characterize companions in scanning space astrometric time series as well as via a combination of astrometric and radial velocity time series. We propose a general linear periodogram framework and we derive analytical formulas for the false alarm probability (FAP) of periodogram peaks. Once a significant peak has been identified, we provide analytical estimates of all the orbital elements of the companion based on the Fourier decomposition of the signal. The periodogram, FAP, and orbital elements estimates can be computed for the astrometric and radial velocity time series separately or in tandem. These methods are complementary with more accurate and more computationally intensive numerical algorithms (e.g., least-squares minimization, Markov chain Monte Carlo, genetic algorithms). In particular, our analytical approximations can be used as an initial condition to accelerate the convergence of numerical algorithms. Our formalism has been partially implemented in the Gaia exoplanet pipeline for the third Gaia data release. Since the Gaia astrometric time series are not yet publicly available, we illustrate our methods on the basis of Hipparcos data, together with on-ground CORALIE radial velocities, for three targets known to host a companion: HD 223636 (HIP 117622), HD 17289 (HIP 12726), and HD 3277 (HIP 2790).

|The role of magnetic fields in the formation of protostars, disks, and outflows||Yusuke Tsukamoto et al.||http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13765v1|
We present our current understanding of the formation and early evolution of protostars, protoplanetary disks, and the driving of outflows as dictated by the interplay of magnetic fields and partially ionized gas in molecular cloud cores. In recent years, the field has witnessed enormous development through sub-millimeter observations which in turn have constrained models of protostar formation. As a result of these observations % that the observations provided, the state-of-the-art theoretical understanding of the formation and evolution of young stellar objects is described. In particular, we emphasize the importance of the coupling, decoupling, and re-coupling between weakly ionized gas and the magnetic field on appropriate scales. This highlights the complex and intimate relationship between gravitational collapse and magnetic fields in young protostars.
