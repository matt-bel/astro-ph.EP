|NaCl & KCl in Io's Atmosphere|Erin Redwing et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12974v1|

### Abstract
We present the first comprehensive study of NaCl and KCl gases in Io's atmosphere in order to investigate their characteristics, and to infer properties of Io's volcanoes and subsurface magma chambers. In this work, we compile all past spectral line observations of NaCl and KCl in Io's atmosphere from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and use atmospheric models to constrain the physical properties of the gases on several dates between 2012 and 2018. NaCl and KCl appear to be largely spatially confined and for observations with high spectral resolution, the temperatures are high (~500-1000 K), implying a volcanic origin. The ratio of NaCl:KCl was found to be ~5-6 in June 2015 and ~3.5-10 in June 2016, which is consistent with predictions based on observations of Io's extended atmosphere, and less than half the Na:K ratio in chondrites. Assuming these gases are volcanic in origin, these ratios imply a magma temperature of ~1300 K, such that the magma will preferentially outgas KCl over NaCl.

|Precise Dynamical Masses of New Directly Imaged Companions from Combining Relative Astrometry, Radial Velocities, and Hipparcos-Gaia eDR3 Accelerations|E. L. Rickman et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12957v1|

### Abstract
Aims. With an observing time span of more than 20 years, the CORALIE radial-velocity survey is able to detect long-term trends in data corresponding to companions with masses and separations accessible to direct imaging. Combining exoplanet detection techniques such as radial-velocities from the CORALIE survey, astrometric accelerations from Hipparcos and Gaia eDR3, and relative astrometry from direct imaging, removes the degeneracy of unknown orbital parameters. This allows precise model-independent masses of detected companions to be derived, which provides a powerful tool to test models of stellar and substellar mass-luminosity relations. Methods. Long-term precise Doppler measurements with the CORALIE spectrograph reveal radial-velocity signatures of companions on long-period orbits. The long baseline of radial-velocity data allows the detectability of such companion candidates to be assessed with direct imaging. We combine long-period radial-velocity data with absolute astrometry from Hipparcos and Gaia eDR3 and relative astrometry derived from new direct imaging detections with VLT/SPHERE to fit orbital parameters and derive precise dynamical masses of these companions. Results. In this paper we report the discovery of new companions orbiting HD~142234, HD~143616, and HIP~22059, as well as the first direct detection of HD~92987~B, and update the dynamical masses of two previously directly imaged companions; HD~157338~B and HD~195010~B. The companions span a period range of 32 to 273 years and are all very low mass stellar companions, ranging from 225 to 477~$M_{\rm{Jup}}$. We compare the derived dynamical masses to mass-luminosity relations of very low mass stars (<0.5~$M_{\odot}$), and discuss the importance of using precursor radial-velocity and astrometric information to inform the future of high-contrast imaging of exoplanets and brown dwarfs

|Is LTT 1445 Ab a Hycean World or a cold Haber World? Exploring the Potential of Twinkle to Unveil Its Nature|Caprice Phillips et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12919v1|

### Abstract
We explore the prospects for Twinkle to determine the atmospheric composition of the nearby terrestrial-like planet LTT 1445 Ab, including the possibility of detecting the potential biosignature ammonia (NH$_{3}$). At a distance of 6.9 pc, this system is the second closest known transiting system and will be observed through transmission spectroscopy with the upcoming Twinkle mission. Twinkle is equipped with a 0.45 m telescope, covers a spectral wavelength range of 0.5 - 4.5 $\mu$m simultaneously with a resolving power between 50 - 70, and is designed to study exoplanets, bright stars, and solar system objects. We investigate the mission's potential to study LTT 1445 Ab and find that Twinkle data can distinguish between a cold Haber World (N$_2$-H$_2$-dominated atmosphere) and a Hycean World with a H$_2$O-H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, with a $\chi_{\nu}^{2}$ = 3.01. Interior composition analysis favors a Haber World scenario for LTT 1445 Ab, which suggests that the planet probably lacks a substantial water layer. We use petitRADTRANS and a Twinkle simulator to simulate transmission spectra for the more likely scenario of a cold Haber World for which NH$_{3}$ is considered to be a biosignature. We study the detectability under different scenarios: varying hydrogen fraction, concentration of ammonia, and cloud coverage. We find that ammonia can be detected at a $\sim$ 3$\sigma$ level for optimal (non-cloudy) conditions with 25 transits and a volume mixing ration of 4.0 ppm of NH$_{3}$. We provide examples of retrieval analysis to constrain potential NH$_{3}$ and H$_{2}$O in the atmosphere. Our study illustrates the potential of Twinkle to characterize atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.

|The TEMPO Survey I: Predicting Yields of the Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and Planets from a 30-day Survey of Orion with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope|Mary Anne Limbach et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12916v1|

### Abstract
We present design considerations for the Transiting Exosatellites, Moons, and Planets in Orion (TEMPO) Survey with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. This proposed 30-day survey is designed to detect a population of transiting extrasolar satellites, moons, and planets in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). The young (1-3 Myr), densely-populated ONC harbors about a thousand bright brown dwarfs (BDs) and free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs). TEMPO offers sufficient photometric precision to monitor FFPs with ${\rm M}\geq1{\rm M}_{\rm J}$ for transiting satellites. The survey is also capable of detecting FFPs down to sub-Saturn masses via direct imaging, although follow-up confirmation will be challenging. TEMPO yield estimates include 14 (3-22) exomoons/satellites transiting FFPs and 54 (8-100) satellites transiting BDs. Of this population, approximately $50\%$ of companions would be "super-Titans" (Titan to Earth mass). Yield estimates also include approximately $150$ exoplanets transiting young Orion stars, of which $>50\%$ will orbit mid-to-late M dwarfs and approximately ten will be proto-habitable zone, terrestrial ($0.1{\rm M}_{\oplus} - 5{\rm M}_{\oplus}$) exoplanets. TEMPO would provide the first census demographics of small exosatellites orbiting FFPs and BDs, while simultaneously offering insights into exoplanet evolution at the earliest stages. This detected exosatellite population is likely to be markedly different from the current census of exoplanets with similar masses (e.g., Earth-mass exosatellites that still possess H/He envelopes). Although our yield estimates are highly uncertain, as there are no known exoplanets or exomoons analogous to these satellites, the TEMPO survey would test the prevailing theories of exosatellite formation and evolution, which limit the certainty surrounding detection yields.

|A New Method for Finding Nearby White Dwarf Exoplanets and Detecting Biosignatures|Mary Anne Limbach et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12914v1|

### Abstract
We demonstrate that the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can detect infrared (IR) excess from the blended light spectral energy distribution of spatially unresolved terrestrial exoplanets orbiting nearby white dwarfs. We find that JWST is capable of detecting warm (habitable-zone; T$_{\rm eq}$=287 K) Earths or super-Earths and hot (400-1000 K) Mercury analogs in the blended light spectrum around the nearest 15 isolated white dwarfs with 10 hrs of integration per target using MIRI's Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS). Further, these observations constrain the presence of a CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere on these planets. The technique is nearly insensitive to system inclination, and thus observation of even a small sample of white dwarfs could place strong limits on the occurrence rates of warm terrestrial exoplanets around white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. We find that JWST can also detect exceptionally cold (100-150 K) Jupiter-sized exoplanets via MIRI broadband imaging at $\lambda = 21\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ for the 34 nearest ($<13$ pc) solitary white dwarfs with 2 hrs of integration time per target. Using IR excess to detect thermal variations with orbital phase or spectral absorption features within the atmosphere, both of which are possible with long-baseline MRS observations, would confirm candidates as actual exoplanets. Assuming an Earth-like atmospheric composition, we find that the detection of the biosignature pair O$_3$+CH$_4$ is possible for all habitable-zone Earths (within 6.5 pc; six white dwarf systems) or super-Earths (within 10 pc; 17 systems) orbiting white dwarfs with only 5-36 hrs of integration using MIRI's Low Resolution Spectrometer (LRS).

|High resolution ALMA and HST imaging of $κ$CrB: a broad debris disc around a post-main sequence star with low-mass companions|J. B. Lovell et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12910v1|

### Abstract
$\kappa$CrB is a ${\sim}2.5\,$Gyr old K1 sub-giant star, with an eccentric exo-Jupiter at ${\sim}2.8\,$au and a debris disc at tens of au. We present ALMA Band 6 ($1.3\,$mm) and HST scattered light ($0.6\,\mu$m) images, demonstrating $\kappa$CrB's broad debris disc, covering an extent $50{-}180\,$au in the millimetre (peaking at $110\,$au), and $51{-}280\,$au in scattered light (peaking at $73\,$au). By modelling the millimetre emission, we estimate the dust mass as ${\sim}0.016\,M{\oplus}$, and constrain lower-limit planetesimal sizes as $D_{\rm{max}}{>}1\,$km and the planetesimal belt mass as $M_{\rm{disc}}{>}1\,M_{\oplus}$. We constrain the properties of an outer body causing a linear trend in 17 years of radial velocity data to have a semi-major axis $8{-}66\,$au and a mass $(0.4{-}120)\,M_{\rm{Jup}}$. There is a large inner cavity seen in the millimetre emission, which we show is consistent with carving by such an outer massive companion with a string of lower mass planets. Our scattered light modelling shows that the dust must have a high anisotropic scattering factor ($g{\sim}0.8{-}0.9$) but an inclination ($i{\sim}30{-}40\,$degrees) that is inferred to be significantly lower than the $i{\sim}61\,$degrees millimetre inclination. The origin of such a discrepancy is unclear, but could be caused by a misalignment in the micron and millimetre sized dust. We place an upper limit on the CO gas mass of $M_{\rm{CO}}{<}(4.2{-}13){\times}10^{-7}\,M_{\oplus}$, and show this to be consistent with levels expected from planetesimal collisions, or from CO-ice sublimation as $\kappa$CrB begins its giant branch ascent.

|On the characterization of GJ 504: a magnetically active planet-host star observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)|Maria Pia Di Mauro et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12752v1|

### Abstract
We present the results of the analysis of the photometric data collected in long and short-cadence mode by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for GJ 504, a well studied planet-hosting solar-like star, whose fundamental parameters have been largely debated during the last decade. Several attempts have been made by the present authors to isolate the oscillatory properties expected on this main-sequence star, but we did not find any presence of solar-like pulsations. The suppression of the amplitude of the acoustic modes can be explained by the high level of magnetic activity revealed for this target, not only by the study of the photometric light-curve, but also by the analysis of three decades available of Mount Wilson spectroscopic data. In particular, our measurements of the stellar rotational period Prot=3.4 d and of the main principal magnetic cycle of 12 a confirm previous findings and allow us to locate this star in the early main sequence phase of its evolution during which the chromospheric activity is dominated by the superposition of several cycles before the transition to the phase of the magnetic-braking shutdown with the subsequent decrease of the magnetic activity.

|Kinematical Constraint on Eccentricity in the Protoplanetary Disk MWC 758 with ALMA|I-Hsuan Genevieve Kuo et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12741v1|

### Abstract
We analyzed the archival data of the $^{13}\mathrm{CO}$ and $\mathrm{C}^{18}\mathrm{O}$ $J=3-2$ emission lines in the protoplanetary disk around MWC 758 obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array to discuss possible planet-disk interaction and non-Keplerian motion in the disk. We performed fitting of a Keplerian disk model to the observational data and measured the velocity deviations from the Keplerian rotation. We found significant velocity deviations around the inner cavity in the MWC 758 disk. We examined several possibilities that may cause the velocity deviations, such as pressure gradient, height of the emitting layer, infall motion, inner warp, and eccentricity in the disk. We found that the combination of an eccentric orbital motion with eccentricity of $0.1\pm0.04$ at the radius of the inner cavity and an infalling flow best explains the observed velocity deviations. Our kinematically constrained eccentricity of the gas orbital motion close to the inner cavity is consistent with the eccentricity of the dust ring around the inner cavity measured in the submillimeter continuum emission. Our results hint at strong dust-gas coupling around the inner cavity and presence of a gas giant planet inside the inner cavity in the MWC 758 disk.

|Multi-Hour Ahead Dst Index Prediction Using Multi-Fidelity Boosted Neural Networks|A. Hu et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12571v1|

### Abstract
The Disturbance storm time (Dst) index has been widely used as a proxy for the ring current intensity, and therefore as a measure of geomagnetic activity. It is derived by measurements from four ground magnetometers in the geomagnetic equatorial regions.   We present a new model for predicting $Dst$ with a lead time between 1 and 6 hours. The model is first developed using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network that is trained using solar wind parameters. The uncertainty of the $Dst$ model is then estimated by using the ACCRUE method [Camporeale et al. 2021]. Finally, a multi-fidelity boosting method is developed in order to enhance the accuracy of the model and reduce its associated uncertainty. It is shown that the developed model can predict $Dst$ 6 hours ahead with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 13.54 $\mathrm{nT}$. This is significantly better than the persistence model and a simple GRU model.

|Lightning-induced chemistry on tidally-locked Earth-like exoplanets|Marrick Braam et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12502v1|

### Abstract
Determining the habitability and interpreting atmospheric spectra of exoplanets requires understanding their atmospheric physics and chemistry. We use a 3-D Coupled Climate-Chemistry Model, the Met Office Unified Model with the UK Chemistry and Aerosols framework, to study the emergence of lightning and its chemical impact on tidally-locked Earth-like exoplanets. We simulate the atmosphere of Proxima Centauri b orbiting in the Habitable Zone of its M-dwarf star, but the results apply to similar M-dwarf orbiting planets. Our chemical network includes the Chapman ozone reactions and hydrogen oxide (HO$_{\mathrm{x}}$=H+OH+HO$_2$) and nitrogen oxide (NO$_{\mathrm{x}}$=NO+NO$_2$) catalytic cycles. We find that photochemistry driven by stellar radiation (177-850 nm) supports a global ozone layer between 20-50 km. We parameterise lightning flashes as a function of cloud-top height and the resulting production of nitric oxide (NO) from the thermal decomposition of N$_2$ and O$_2$. Rapid dayside convection over and around the substellar point results in lightning flash rates of up to 0.16 flashes km$^{-2}$yr$^{-1}$, enriching the dayside atmosphere below altitudes of 20 km in NO$_{\mathrm{x}}$. Changes in dayside ozone are determined mainly by UV irradiance and the HO$_{\mathrm{x}}$ catalytic cycle. ~45% of the planetary dayside surface remains at habitable temperatures (T$_{\mathrm{surf}}$>273.15 K) and the ozone layer reduces surface UV radiation levels to 15%. Dayside-nightside thermal gradients result in strong winds that subsequently advect NO$_{\mathrm{x}}$ towards the nightside, where the absence of photochemistry allows NO$_{\mathrm{x}}$ chemistry to involve reservoir species. Our study also emphasizes the need for accurate UV stellar spectra to understand the atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets.

|MASADA: From Microlensing Planet Mass-Ratio Function to Planet Mass Function|Andrew Gould et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12501v1|

### Abstract
Using current technology, gravitational microlensing is the only method that can measure planet masses over the full parameter space of planet and stellar-host masses and at a broad range of planet-host separations. I present a comprehensive program to transform the $\sim 150$ planet/host mass ratio measurements from the first 6 full seasons of the KMTNet survey into planet mass measurements via late-time adaptive optics (AO) imaging on 30m-class telescopes. This program will enable measurements of the overall planet mass function, the planet frequency as a function of Galactic environment and the planet mass functions within different environments. I analyze a broad range of discrete and continuous degeneracies as well as various false positives and false negatives, and I present a variety of methods to resolve these. I analyze the propagation from measurement uncertainties to mass and distance errors and show that these present the greatest difficulties for host masses $0.13\lesssim(M/M_\odot)\lesssim 0.4$, i.e., fully convective stars supported by the ideal gas law, and for very nearby hosts. While work can begin later this decade using AO on current telescopes, of order 90% of the target sample must await 30m-class AO. I present extensive tables with information that is useful to plan observations of more than 100 of these planets and provide additional notes for a majority of these. Applying the same approach to two earlier surveys with 6 and 8 planets, respectively, I find that 11 of these 14 planets already have mass measurements by a variety of techniques. These provide suggestive evidence that planet frequency may be higher for nearby stars, $D_L\lesssim 4$ kpc compared to those in or near the Galactic bulge. Finally, I analyze the prospects for making the planet mass-function measurement for the case that current astronomical capabilities are seriously degraded.

|Isolating the mechanisms for asteroid surface refreshing|F. E. DeMeo et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12366v1|

### Abstract
Evidence is seen for young, fresh surfaces among Near-Earth and Main-Belt asteroids even though space-weathering timescales are shorter than the age of the surfaces. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to refresh asteroid surfaces on short timescales, such as planetary encounters, YORP spinup, thermal degradation, and collisions. Additionally, other factors such as grain size effects have been proposed to explain the existence of these "fresh-looking" spectra. To investigate the role each of these mechanisms may play, we collected a sample of visible and near-infrared spectra of 477 near-Earth and Mars Crosser asteroids with similar sizes and compositions - all with absolute magnitude H > 16 and within the S-complex and having olivine to pyroxene (ol/(ol+opx)) ratios > 0.65. We taxonomically classify these objects in the Q (fresh) and S (weathered) classes. We find four trends in the Q/S ratio: 1) previous work demonstrated the Q/S ratio increases at smaller sizes down to H<16, but we find a sharp increase near H=19 after which the ratio decreases monotonically 2) in agreement with many previous studies, the Q/S ratio increases with decreasing perihelion distance, and we find it is non-zero for larger perihelia greater than 1.2AU, 3) as a new finding our work reveals the Q/S ratio has a sharp, significant peak near 5 degrees orbital inclination, and 4) we confirm previous findings that the Q/S ratio is higher for objects that have the possibility of encounter with Earth and Venus versus those that don't, however this finding cannot be distinguished from the perihelion trend. No single resurfacing mechanism can explain all of these trends, so multiple mechanisms are required. It is likely that a combination of all four resurfacing mechanisms are needed to account for all observational trends.

|Tidally-induced migration of TESS gas giants orbiting M dwarfs|Jaime A. Alvarado-Montes et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11375v2|

### Abstract
According to core-accretion formation models, the conditions under which gas giants will form around M dwarfs are very restrictive. Also, the correlation of the occurrence of these planets with the metallicity of host stars is still unknown due to the intrinsic faintness of M dwarfs in the optical and some intricacies in their spectra. Interestingly, NASA's TESS mission has started to create a growing sample of these systems, with eleven observed planets located in close-in orbits: contrary to what is expected for low stellar masses. Tidal interactions with the host star will play a key role in determining the fate of these planets, so by using the measured physical and orbital characteristics of these M-dwarf systems we numerically analyse the exchange of rotational and orbital angular momentum, while constraining the energy dissipation in each system to calculate whether host stars are spun up or spun down, depending on the relationship between the gain and loss of angular momentum by the stellar rotation. We also study the coupled orbital and physical evolution of their gas giant companion and calculate orbital circularization time-scales, as well as the time needed to undergo orbital decay from their current orbital position to the Roche limit. The thorough study of tidal processes occurring over short and long time-scales in star-planet systems like those studied here, can help constrain tidal dissipation rates inside the star and planet, complement tidal theories, and improve estimations of unconstrained properties of exoplanetary systems.

|Analysis of Gaia radial-velocity standards: stability and new substellar companion candidates|A. Boulkaboul et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08624v2|

### Abstract
Our main aim is to test the non-variability of the radial velocity (RV) of a sample of 2351 standard stars used for wavelength calibration of the RVS instrument onboard Gaia. In this paper, we present the spectroscopic analysis of these stars with the determination of their physical parameters by matching observed and synthetic spectra. We estimate the offset between different instruments after determining the shift between measured and archived RVs since the instrument pipelines use various numerical masks. Through the confirmation of the stability of the target RVs, we find 68 stars with a long-term variation having an acceleration which exceeds $10 \,\rm{m\, s^{-1}yr^{-1}}$. This suggests a barycentric reflex motion caused by a companion. As activity phenomena may be the source of periodic and trend-like RV variations in stars with putative planetary companions, we analysed various activity indicators in order to check their correlations to the RV changes. Among the trend stars, 18 have a trend model scatter greater than $100 \,\rm{m\, s^{-1}}$ over a time span from 10 to 12 years. We also confirm that six stars with known substellar companions have a total model scatter, $3\sigma$, exceeding the threshold set by Gaia, that is, $300 \,\rm{m\, s^{-1}}$. In addition, TYC8963-01543-1 an SB2 star has data scatter $\sigma = 176.6\, \rm{m\, s^{-1}}$. Four more other stars are revealed to be variable after combining data from different instruments. Despite the presence of low-amplitude changes, a very large fraction of our sample (98.8\%) appears suitable as RV calibrators for Gaia RVS.
