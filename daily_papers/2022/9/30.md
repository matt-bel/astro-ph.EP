|Investigating 2M1155-7919B: a Nearby, Young, Low-Mass Star Actively Accreting from a Nearly Edge-on, Dusty Disk|D. Annie Dickson-Vandervelde et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14917v1|

### Abstract
We investigate the nature of an unusually faint member of the $\epsilon$ Cha Association ($D\sim100$ pc, age $\sim5$ Myr), the nearest region of star formation of age $<$8 Myr. This object, 2MASS J11550336-7919147 (2M1155$-$79B), is a wide ($\sim$580 AU) separation, comoving companion to low-mass (M3) $\epsilon$ Cha Association member 2MASS J11550485-7919108 (2M1155$-$79A). We present near-infrared spectra of both components, along with analysis of photometry from Gaia EDR3, 2MASS, VHS, and WISE. The near-IR spectrum of 2M1155$-$79B displays strong He I 1.083 emission, a sign of active accretion and/or accretion-driven winds from a circumstellar disk. Analysis of WISE archival data reveals that the mid-infrared excess previously associated with 2M1155$-$79A instead originates from the disk surrounding 2M1155$-$79B. Based on these results, as well as radiative transfer modeling of its optical/IR spectral energy distribution, we conclude that 2M1155$-$79B is most likely a young, late-M, star that is partially obscured by, and actively accreting from, a nearly edge-on circumstellar disk. This would place 2M1155$-$79B among the rare group of nearby ($D\lesssim100$ pc), young (age $<$10 Myr) mid-M stars that are orbited by and accreting from highly inclined protoplanetary disks. Like these systems, the 2M1155$-$79B system is a particularly promising subject for studies of star and planet formation around low-mass stars.

|An old warm Jupiter orbiting the metal-poor G-dwarf TOI-5542|Nolan Grieves et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14830v1|

### Abstract
We report the discovery of a 1.32$^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$ $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$ planet orbiting on a 75.12 day period around the G3V $10.8^{+2.1}_{-3.6}$ Gyr old star TOI-5542 (TIC 466206508; TYC 9086-1210-1). The planet was first detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) as a single transit event in TESS Sector 13. A second transit was observed 376 days later in TESS Sector 27. The planetary nature of the object has been confirmed by ground-based spectroscopic and radial velocity observations from the CORALIE and HARPS spectrographs. A third transit event was detected by the ground-based facilities NGTS, EulerCam, and SAAO. We find the planet has a radius of 1.009$^{+0.036}_{-0.035}$ $\mathrm{R_{\rm Jup}}$ and an insolation of 9.6$^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ $S_{\oplus}$, along with a circular orbit that most likely formed via disk migration or in situ formation, rather than high-eccentricity migration mechanisms. Our analysis of the HARPS spectra yields a host star metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-$0.21$\pm$0.08, which does not follow the traditional trend of high host star metallicity for giant planets and does not bolster studies suggesting a difference among low- and high-mass giant planet host star metallicities. Additionally, when analyzing a sample of 216 well-characterized giant planets, we find that both high masses (4 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$ $<M_{p}<$ 13 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$) and low masses (0.5 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$ $<M_{p}<$ 4 $\mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$), as well as both both warm (P $>$ 10 days) and hot (P $<$ 10 days) giant planets are preferentially located around metal-rich stars (mean [Fe/H] $>$ 0.1). TOI-5542b is one of the oldest known warm Jupiters and it is cool enough to be unaffected by inflation due to stellar incident flux, making it a valuable contribution in the context of planetary composition and formation studies.

|Synthesizing Spectra from 3D Radiation Hydrodynamic Models of Massive Stars Using Monte Carlo Radiation Transport|William C. Schultz et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14772v1|

### Abstract
Observations indicate that turbulent motions are present on most massive star surfaces. Starting from the observed phenomena of spectral lines with widths much larger than thermal broadening (e.g. micro- and macroturbulence) to the detection of stochastic low-frequency variability (SLFV) in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry, these stars clearly have large scale turbulent motions on their surfaces. The cause of this turbulence is debated, with near-surface convection zones, core internal gravity waves, and wind variability being proposed. Our 3D grey radiation hydrodynamic (RHD) models characterized the surfaces' convective dynamics driven by near-surface convection zones and provided a reasonable match to the observed SLFV in the most luminous massive stars. We now explore the complex emitting surfaces of these 3D RHD models, which strongly violate the 1D assumption of a plane parallel atmosphere. By post-processing the grey RHD models with the Monte Carlo radiation transport code SEDONA, we synthesize stellar spectra and extract information from the broadening of individual photospheric lines. The use of SEDONA enables the calculation of the viewing angle and temporal dependence of spectral absorption line profiles. Combining uncorrelated temporal snapshots together, we compare the broadening from the 3D RHD models' velocity fields to the thermal broadening of the extended emitting region, showing that our synthesized spectral lines closely resemble the observed macroturbulent broadening from similarly luminous stars. More generally, the new techniques we have developed will allow for systematic studies of the origin of turbulent velocity broadening from any future 3D simulations.

|Modification of the radioactive heat budget of Earth-like exoplanets by the loss of primordial atmospheres|N. Erkaev et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14691v1|

### Abstract
The initial abundance of radioactive heat producing isotopes in the interior of a terrestrial planet are important drivers of its thermal evolution and the related tectonics and possible evolution to an Earth-like habitat. The moderately volatile element K can be outgassed from a magma ocean into H$_2$-dominated primordial atmospheres of protoplanets with assumed masses between 0.55-1.0$ M_{\rm Earth}$ at the time when the gas disk evaporated. We estimate this outgassing and let these planets grow through impacts of depleted and non-depleted material that resembles the same $^{40}$K abundance of average carbonaceous chondrites until the growing protoplanets reach 1.0 $M_{\rm Earth}$. We examine different atmospheric compositions and, as a function of pressure and temperature, calculate the proportion of K by Gibbs Free Energy minimisation using the GGChem code. We find that for H$_2$-envelopes and for magma ocean surface temperatures that are $\ge$ 2500 K, no K condensates are thermally stable, so that outgassed $^{40}$K can populate the atmosphere to a great extent. However, due to magma ocean turn-over time and the limited diffusion of $^{40}$K into the upper atmosphere, from the entire $^{40}$K in the magma ocean only a fraction may be available for escaping into space. The escape rates of the primordial atmospheres and the dragged $^{40}$K are further simulated for different stellar EUV-activities with a multispecies hydrodynamic upper atmosphere evolution model. Our results lead to different abundances of heat producing elements within the fully grown planets which may give rise to different thermal and tectonic histories of terrestrial planets and their habitability conditions.

|Predicted diversity in water content of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs|Tadahiro Kimura et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14563v1|

### Abstract
Exoplanet surveys around M dwarfs have detected a growing number of exoplanets with Earth-like insolation. It is expected that some of those planets are rocky planets with the potential for temperate climates favourable to surface liquid water. However, various models predict that terrestrial planets orbiting in the classical habitable zone around M dwarfs have no water or too much water, suggesting that habitable planets around M dwarfs might be rare. Here we present the results of an updated planetary population synthesis model, which includes the effects of water enrichment in the primordial atmosphere, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric hydrogen by rocky materials from incoming planetesimals and from the magma ocean. We find that this water production in the primordial atmosphere is found to significantly impact the occurrence of terrestrial rocky aqua planets, yielding ones with diverse water content. We estimate that 5-10% of the planets with a size $<1.3 R_\oplus$ orbiting early-to-mid M dwarfs have appropriate amounts of seawater for habitability. Such an occurrence rate would be high enough to detect potentially habitable planets by ongoing and near-future M-dwarf planet survey missions.
