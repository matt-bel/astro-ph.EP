|Albedo variegation on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko|Bj√∂rn J. R. Davidsson et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13730v1|

### Abstract
We here study the level of albedo variegation on the nucleus of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This is done by fitting the parameters of a standard photometric phase function model to disk-average radiance factor data in images acquired by the Rosetta/OSIRIS Narrow Angle Camera in the orange filter. Local discrepancies between the observed radiance factor and the disk-average solution are interpreted as a proxy W of the local single-scattering albedo. We find a wide range 0.02<W<0.09 around an average of W=0.055. The observed albedo variegation is strongly correlated with nucleus morphology - smooth terrain is brighter, and consolidated terrain is darker, than average. Furthermore, we find that smooth terrain darken prior to morphological changes, and that stratigraphically low terrain (with respect to the centre of each nucleus lobe) is brighter than stratigraphically high terrain. We propose that the observed albedo variegation is due to differences in porosity and the coherent effect: compaction causes small brighter particles to act collectively as larger optically effective particles, that are darker. Accordingly, we consider the dark consolidated terrain materials more compacted than smooth terrain materials, and darkening of the latter is due to subsidence.

|Validation of TOI-1221 b, a warm sub-Neptune exhibiting TTVs around a Sun-like star|Christopher R. Mann et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13651v1|

### Abstract
We present a successful validation of the long-period ($91.68278^{+0.00032}_{-0.00041}$ days) transiting sub-Neptune planet TOI-1221 b (TIC 349095149.01) around a Sun-like (m$_{\rm V}$=10.5) star. We combine {\it TESS} light curve measurements and ground-based time-series photometry from PEST (0.3~m) and LCOGT (1.0~m) to analyze the transit light curves and rule out nearby stars as potential eclipsing binary contaminants. High-contrast imaging from SOAR and Gemini/Zorro rule out nearby stellar contaminants down to $\Delta$mag = 5 at separation $r = 0.1"$. Reconnaissance spectroscopy from CHIRON sets a planetary upper limit on the mass of the object (1.1 and 3.5 M$_{\rm Jup}$ at 1$\sigma$ and 3$\sigma$, respectively) and shows no sign of a spectroscopic binary companion. We fit a planetary radius $R_{\rm p}/R_\star=0.02679^{+0.00067}_{-0.00056}$ corresponding to $R_{\rm p} = 2.91^{+0.13}_{-0.12} R_{\oplus}$, placing it in the sub-Neptune regime. It's orbital semi-major axis of $a=0.404^{+0.026}_{-0.023}$ au predicts an insolation of $S = 5.57^{+0.75}_{-0.68}\ S_{\oplus}$, suggesting a moderate equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq} =$ 400 K given a Neptune-like model. In analyzing 8 transits, we find significant evidence (> $5\sigma$) of sinusoidal transit timing variations with amplitude of $23.0^{+5.2}_{-4.1}$ minutes, and a super-period of $485^{+15}_{-19}$ days. We find a false positive probability from TRICERATOPS of FPP $ = 0.0014 \pm 0.0003$ as well as other qualitative and quantitative evidence to support the statistical validation of TOI-1221 b.

|Regularization of the Hill four-body problem with oblate bodies|Edward Belbruno et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13625v1|

### Abstract
We consider the Hill four-body problem where three oblate, massive bodies form a relative equilibrium triangular configuration, and the fourth, infinitesimal body orbits in a neighborhood of the smallest of the three massive bodies. We regularize collisions between the infinitesimal body and the smallest massive body, via McGehee coordinate transformation. We describe the corresponding collision manifold and show that it undergoes a bifurcation when the oblateness coefficient of the small massive body passes through the zero value.

|Evaporation before disruption: comparing timescales for Jovian planets in star-forming regions|Emma C. Daffern-Powell et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13601v1|

### Abstract
Simulations show that the orbits of planets are readily disrupted in dense star-forming regions; planets can be exchanged between stars, become free-floating and then be captured by other stars. However, dense star-forming regions also tend to be populous, containing massive stars that emit photoionising radiation, which can evaporate the gas in protoplanetary discs. We analyse N-body simulations of star-forming regions containing Jovian-mass planets and determine the times when their orbits are altered, when they become free-floating, and when they are stolen or captured. Simultaneously, we perform calculations of the evolution of protoplanetary discs when exposed to FUV radiation fields from massive stars in the same star-forming regions. In almost half (44 per cent) of the planetary systems that are disrupted - either altered, captured, stolen or become free-floating, we find that the radius of the protoplanetary disc evolves inwards, or the gas in the disc is completely evaporated, before the planets' orbits are disrupted. This implies that planets that are disrupted in dense, populous star-forming regions are more likely to be super Earths or mini Neptunes, as Jovian mass planets would not be able to form due to mass loss from photoevaporation. Furthermore, the recent discoveries of distant Jovian mass planets around tightly-packed terrestrial planets argue against their formation in populous star-forming regions, as photoevaporation would preclude gas giant planet formation at distances of more than a few au.

|Predicting Swarm Equatorial Plasma Bubbles Via Supervised Machine Learning|S. Reddy et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13482v1|

### Abstract
Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) are plumes of low density plasma that rise up from the bottomside of the F layer towards the exosphere. EPBs are known causes of radio wave scintillations which can degrade communications with spacecraft. We build a random forest regressor to predict and forecast the probability of an EPB [0-1] detected by the IBI processor on-board the SWARM spacecraft. We use 8-years of Swarm data from 2014 to 2021 and transform the data from a time series into a 5 dimensional space consisting of latitude, longitude, mlt, year, and day-of-the-year. We also add Kp, F10.7cm and solar wind speed. The observations of EPBs with respect to geolocation, local time, season and solar activity mostly agrees with existing work, whilst the link geomagnetic activity is less clear. The prediction has an accuracy of 88% and performs well across the EPB specific spatiotemporal scales. This proves that the XGBoost method is able to successfully capture the climatological and daily variability of SWARM EPBs. Capturing the daily variance has long evaded researchers because of local and stochastic features within the ionosphere. We take advantage of Shapley Values to explain the model and to gain insight into the physics of EPBs. We find that as the solar wind speed increases the probability of an EPB decreases. We also identify a spike in EPB probability around the Earth-Sun perihelion. Both of these insights were derived directly from the XGBoost and Shapley technique.

|Reduced late bombardment on rocky exoplanets around M-dwarfs|Tim Lichtenberg et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14037v1|

### Abstract
Ocean-vaporizing impacts of chemically reduced planetesimals onto the early Earth have been suggested to catalyse atmospheric production of reduced nitrogen compounds and trigger prebiotic synthesis despite an oxidized lithosphere. While geochemical evidence supports a dry, highly reduced late veneer on Earth, the composition of late-impacting debris around lower-mass stars is subject to variable volatile loss as a result of their hosts' extended pre-main sequence phase. We perform simulations of late-stage planet formation across the M-dwarf mass spectrum to derive upper limits on reducing bombardment epochs in Hadean analog environments. We contrast the Solar System scenario with varying initial volatile distributions due to extended primordial runaway greenhouse phases on protoplanets and desiccation of smaller planetesimals by internal radiogenic heating. We find a decreasing rate of late-accreting reducing impacts with decreasing stellar mass. Young planets around stars $\leq$ 0.4 $M_\odot$ experience no impacts of sufficient mass to generate prebiotically relevant concentrations of reduced atmospheric compounds once their stars have reached the main sequence. For M-dwarf planets to not exceed Earth-like concentrations of volatiles, both planetesimals and larger protoplanets must undergo extensive devolatilization processes and can typically emerge from long-lived magma ocean phases with sufficient atmophile content to outgas secondary atmospheres. Our results suggest that transiently reducing surface conditions on young rocky exoplanets are favoured around FGK- stellar types relative to M-dwarfs.

|InSight Pressure Data Recalibration, and Its Application to the Study of Long-Term Pressure Changes on Mars|L. Lange et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13412v1|

### Abstract
Observations of the South Polar Residual Cap suggest a possible erosion of the cap, leading to an increase of the global mass of the atmosphere. We test this assumption by making the first comparison between Viking 1 and InSight surface pressure data, which were recorded 40 years apart. Such a comparison also allows us to determine changes in the dynamics of the seasonal ice caps between these two periods. To do so, we first had to recalibrate the InSight pressure data because of their unexpected sensitivity to the sensor temperature. Then, we had to design a procedure to compare distant pressure measurements. We propose two surface pressure interpolation methods at the local and global scale to do the comparison. The comparison of Viking and InSight seasonal surface pressure variations does not show changes larger than +-8 Pa in the CO2 cycle. Such conclusions are supported by an analysis of Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) pressure data. Further comparisons with images of the south seasonal cap taken by the Viking 2 orbiter and MARCI camera do not display significant changes in the dynamics of this cap over a 40 year period. Only a possible larger extension of the North Cap after the global storm of MY 34 is observed, but the physical mechanisms behind this anomaly are not well determined. Finally, the first comparison of MSL and InSight pressure data suggests a pressure deficit at Gale crater during southern summer, possibly resulting from a large presence of dust suspended within the crater.

|HD 23472: A multi-planetary system with three super-Earths and two potential super-Mercuries|S. C. C. Barros et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13345v1|

### Abstract
We report the characterisation of a multi-planetary system composed of five exoplanets orbiting the K-dwarf HD~23472 (TOI-174). In addition to the two super-Earths that were previously confirmed, we confirm and characterise three Earth-size planets in the system using ESPRESSO radial velocity observations. The planets of this compact system have periods of $P_d \sim 3.98\,$, $P_e \sim 7.90\,$, $P_f \sim 12.16\,$, $P_b \sim 17.67,\,$ and $P_c \sim 29.80\,$days and radii of $R_d \sim 0.75\,$ , $R_e \sim 0.82,$, $R_f \sim 1.13\,$, $R_b \sim 2.01,\,$ and, $R_c \sim 1.85\,$ \REarth. Because of its small size, its proximity to planet d's transit, and close resonance with planet d, planet e was only recently found. The planetary masses were estimated to be $M_d =0.54\pm0.22$, $M_e =0.76\pm0.30$, $M_f =0.64_{-0.39}^{+0.46}$, $M_b = 8.42_{-0.84}^{+0.83}$, and $M_c = 3.37_{-0.87}^{+0.92}$ \MEarth. These planets are among the lightest planets, with masses measured using the radial velocity method, demonstrating the very high precision of the ESPRESSO spectrograph. We estimated the composition of the system's five planets and found that their gas and water mass fractions increase with stellar distance, suggesting that the system was shaped by irradiation. The high density of the two inner planets ($\rho_d = 7.5_{-3.1}^{+3.9}$ and $\rho_e = 7.5_{-3.0}^{+3.9}\, \mathrm{g.cm^{-3}}$) indicates that they are likely to be super-Mercuries. This is supported by the modelling of the internal structures of the planets, which also suggests that the three outermost planets have significant water or gas content If the existence of two super-Mercuries in the system is confirmed, this system will be the only one known to feature two super-Mercuries, making it an excellent testing bed for theories of super-Mercuries formation.

|Machine learning-accelerated chemistry modeling of protoplanetary disks|Grigorii V. Smirnov-Pinchukov et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13336v1|

### Abstract
Aims. With the large amount of molecular emission data from (sub)millimeter observatories and incoming James Webb Space Telescope infrared spectroscopy, access to fast forward models of the chemical composition of protoplanetary disks is of paramount importance.   Methods. We used a thermo-chemical modeling code to generate a diverse population of protoplanetary disk models. We trained a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) regressor to instantly predict the chemistry of other disk models.   Results. We show that it is possible to accurately reproduce chemistry using just a small subset of physical conditions, thanks to correlations between the local physical conditions in adopted protoplanetary disk models. We discuss the uncertainties and limitations of this method.   Conclusions. The proposed method can be used for Bayesian fitting of the line emission data to retrieve disk properties from observations. We present a pipeline for reproducing the same approach on other disk chemical model sets.

|Shape model and rotation acceleration of (1685) Toro and (85989) 1999 JD6 from optical observations|Jun Tian et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13333v1|

### Abstract
The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect is a net torque caused by solar radiation directly reflected and thermally re-emitted from the surface of small asteroids and is considered to be crucial in their dynamical evolution. By long-term photometric observations of selected near-Earth asteroids, it's hoped to enlarge asteroid samples with a detected YORP effect to facilitate the development of a theoretical framework. Archived light-curve data are collected and photometric observations are made for (1685) Toro and (85989) 1999 JD6, which enables measurement of their YORP effect by inverting the light curve to fit observations from a convex shape model. For (1685) Toro, a YORP acceleration $\upsilon=(3.2\pm0.3)\times10^{-9}\ \rm{rad\cdot d^{-2}}(1\sigma\ error)$ is updated, which is consistent with previous YORP detection based on different light-curve data; for (85989) 1999 JD6, it is determined that the sidereal period is $7.667749\pm 0.000009$ h, the rotation pole direction locates is at $\lambda=232\pm 2^{\circ},\ \beta = -59\pm 1^{\circ}$, the acceleration is detected to be $\upsilon = (2.4\pm0.3)\times10^{-8}\ \rm{rad\cdot d^{-2}}(1\sigma\ error)$ and in addition to obtaining an excellent agreement between the observations and model. YORP should produce both spin-up and spin-down cases. However, including (85989) 1999 JD6, the $\rm{d}\omega/\rm{d}t$ values of eleven near-Earth asteroids are positive totally, which suggests that there is either a bias in the sample of YORP detections or a real feature needs to be explained.

|Absolute colors and phase coefficients of asteroids|A. Alvarez-Candal et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13246v1|

### Abstract
Context: We use phase curves of small bodies to measure absolute magnitudes and, together with complementary theoretical and laboratory results, to understand their surfaces' micro and macroscopic properties. Although we can observe asteroids up to phase angles of about 30 deg, the range of phase angles covered by outer solar system objects usually does not go further than 7 to 10 deg for centaurs and 2 deg for trans-Neptunian objects, and a linear relation between magnitude and phase angle may be assumed.   Aims: We aim at directly comparing data taken for objects in the inner solar system (inside the orbit of Jupiter) with data of centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects.   Methods: We use the SLOAN Moving Objects Catalog data to construct phase curves restricted to phase angles less than or equal to 7.5 deg, compatible with the angles observed for the trans-Neptunian/Centaur population. We assume a linear model for the photometric behavior to obtain absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients in the ugirz, V, and R filters.   Results: We obtained absolute magnitudes in seven filters for $>4000$ objects. Our comparison with outer solar system objects points to a common property of the surfaces: intrinsically redder objects become blue with increasing phase angle, while the opposite happens for intrinsically bluer objects.

|A low-inclination neutral Trans-Neptunian Object in a extreme orbit|Ying-Tung Chen et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13089v1|

### Abstract
We present photometric observations and numerical simulations of 2016 SD$_{106}$, a low inclination ($i=4.8^{\circ}$) extreme trans-Neptunian Object with a large semi-major axis ($a=350$ au) and perihelion ($q= 42.6$ au). This object possesses a peculiar neutral color of $g-r = 0.45\pm0.05$ and $g-i=0.72\pm0.06$, in comparison with other distant trans-Neptunian objects, all of which have moderate-red to ultra-red colors. A numerical integration based on orbital fitting on astrometric data covering eight years of arc confirms that 2016 SD$_{106}$ is a metastable object without significant scattering evolution. Each of the clones survived at the end of the 1 Gyr simulation. However, very few neutral objects with inclinations $<5^{\circ}$ have been found in the outer solar system, even in the main Kuiper belt. Furthermore, most mechanisms which lift perihelion distances are expected to produce a very low number of extreme objects with inclinations $<5^{\circ}$. We thus explored the possibility that a hypothetical distant planet could increase the production of such objects. Our simulations show that no 2016 SD$_{106}$-like orbits can be produced from three Kuiper belt populations tested (i.e. plutinos, twotinos, and Haumea Family) without the presence of an hypothetical planet, while a few similar orbits can be obtained with it; however, the presence of the additional planet produces a wide range of large semimajor-axis / large perihelion objects, in apparent contradiction with the observed scarcity of objects in those regions of phase space. Future studies may determine if there is a connection between the existence of a perihelion gap and a particular orbital configuration of an hypothetical distant planet.

|TESS search for substellar companions through pulsation timing of $Œ¥$ Scuti stars. I. Discovery of companions around Chang 134 and V393 Car|V. Vaulato et al.|http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01220v2|

### Abstract
Early-type main-sequence pulsating stars such as \ds{} variables are one of the least explored class of targets in the search for exoplanets. Pulsation timing (PT) is an alternative technique to the most effective search methods. It exploits the light-travel-time effect (LTTE) to infer the presence of additional massive bodies around a pulsating star by measuring a periodic phase modulation of its signal. PT has been extremely successful in discovering and characterizing stellar binaries when it was applied to high-precision light curves over long temporal baselines, such as those delivered by the Kepler mission. In favorable conditions, the sensitivity of PT can reach the planetary-mass regime; one such candidate has already been claimed. The advent of TESS, with its nearly full-sky coverage and the availability of full-frame images, opens a great opportunity to expand this field of research. In this work, we present a pilot study aimed to understand the potential of PT as applied to TESS data, which are considerably different from Kepler data in terms of photometric noise, sampling cadence, and temporal baseline. We focused on the most favorable class of \ds{}, that is, those showing strong pulsations and very simple frequency spectra. After the development of a customized pipeline, we were able to detect candidate companions for two targets in the (sub-)stellar mass regime: Chang~134 ($43\pm 5$~$M_\mathrm{jup}$, $P\simeq 82$~d) and V393 Car ($\gtrsim 100$~$M_\mathrm{jup}$, $P\gtrsim 700$~d). Our results also highlight the limiting factors of this technique and the importance of an accurate absolute time calibration for future missions such as PLATO.
